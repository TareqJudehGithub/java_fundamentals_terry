Section 2: Java classes, objects, and methods

    OOP
     - Java was designed to make OOP easier.
     - OOP is a way of programming where we try to model the real world, or concepts to probems
       we are trying to write software for.

     - Classes
      - Classes are blueprints for creating objects.
      - Classes naming convention:
       - A class name should be in the CamelCase format
       - A class name should not be start with a number or an _ (underscore)
       - A class name should be single and not plural.

      public class ClassName {
        
      }

    Variables
    - Variables hold values.
    - We can use variable to store text and numbers as values.
    - Java is a statically-typed language. This means we need to specify data type besides
      the variable it self.

      private String firstName;
        Here, we declaring a variable called firstName.
      

      private String firstName = "Jack";
      Here, we declared a variable firstName, and initialized this variable with the values
      "Jack".
    
    Java Data types - Primitives

     - Stores letters.
    Int
     - Stores numbers.
    
    long
     - Stores larger numbers comparing to int
